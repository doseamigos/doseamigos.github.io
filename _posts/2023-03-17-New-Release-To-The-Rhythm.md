To The Rhythm is a high energy, techy, four on the floor, dance forward song with sparse lyrics that command the listeners to feel the rhythm and the vibe. The combination of groove set by bassline waves in and out of sustained and percussive elements that drive the dynamics of the song. The bassline is contrasted with heavy lead synths, fills, and vocal effects. Some playlists that this style may fit into are Housework, Operator, Night Rider, Nasty Bits, Shuffle Syndrome, and Dance Party.
